# Book Recommender System

A Book Recommender System is a machine learning application designed to suggest books to users based on their preferences, reading history, and other relevant data. This repository contains the code and resources for building and deploying a Book Recommender System.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggest books tailored to user tastes using collaborative and/or content-based filtering.
- **User Profiles:** Store and utilize user data for enhanced recommendations.
- **Book Metadata:** Leverage book information like title, author, genre, and ratings.
- **Interactive Interface:** Simple UI for users to get recommendations.
- **Scalable Algorithms:** Support for different recommendation algorithms (e.g., kNN, matrix factorization, deep learning).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn / Surprise
- Flask / Streamlit (for web/app interface)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experiments)
- SQLite / CSV (for data storage)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Book-Recommender-System.git
   cd Book-Recommender-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the dataset:**
   - Place your book and user datasets in the `data/` folder.

4. **Run the recommender system:**
   - For Jupyter Notebook:
     ```sh
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - For Streamlit app:
     ```sh
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
